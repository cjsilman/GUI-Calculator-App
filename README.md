# GUI-Calculator-App
This is a fully functioning standard calculator hand-built using QT for Python.

Every aspect of this calculator was designed without using QTDesigner.

This calculator has most of the capabilities of the standard Windows Calculator. To build ontop of it, this calculator provides some extra intuitive features to help accelerate and improve ease of use.

Some features include basic automatic expression evaluation without the need to press the = button.
- Unlike the windows standard calculator, using buttons such as 1/x, x^2, %, etc. require an extra press of the button to see what the expression actually equates to

Some features I am looking to include later on is memory management and basic handling of imaginary numbers.
